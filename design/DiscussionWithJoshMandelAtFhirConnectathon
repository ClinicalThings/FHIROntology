Add restriction on extension element at the ExtensibleDataElement level.
Can one make a datatype property equivalent to an object property (eye color = brown vs String.value = brown)
Add a relationship between coding and the terminology (e.g., SNOMED)
Think whether 'Condition is an instance of' SNOMED code should be considered as part of the core ontology (would require importing SNOMED). Probably best done in an ontology extension.
